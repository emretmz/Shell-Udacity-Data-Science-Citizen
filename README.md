# Shell-Udacity-Data-Science-Citizen
This repository is created to share my worksheets regarding Shell Udacity Data Science Citizen Track. 

This is the first worksheet concerned with Data Science Track in Udacity at Shell. In this scope of the course, I review and recovered my Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and Seaborn knowledges. In this worksheet, I worked with a dataset which aims to analyses No-Show of appointments in particular addresses. I stated 3 base questions and 1 follow up question. I plotted straightforward my visuals relevant to answers. Finally, I am happy to announce and share my work here.
